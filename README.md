# üöÄ AI HUB ‚Äì Data Science & MLOps Applications

The **AI HUB** is a centralized collection of hands-on applications focused on **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **MLOps**.

Rather than acting as a monolithic project, AI HUB presents a suite of **independent, modular pages**‚Äîeach demonstrating a specific technique or architecture. These applications are meant to be **practical, production-inspired**, and easily extensible.

## üåü Project Purpose

* Explore real-world applications of DS, ML, and LLMs.
* Compare different strategies for solving similar problems (e.g., recommendation systems).
* Apply modular design principles to ensure each feature is reusable and self-contained.
* Combine classical ML with modern LLM-based workflows.
* Showcase MLOps practices including model serving, configuration via environment variables, and interface modularization.

---

## üß† Concepts Covered

* Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and filtering logic
* Classical ML methods like TF-IDF, cosine similarity, association rules, etc.
* Hosted inference using Hugging Face models via public APIs
* UI modularization with Streamlit components
* Use of LLMs for semantic tasks and entity extraction
* Configuration through environment variables

## üîê Required Environment Variables

Before launching the app, define the following:

| Variable           | Description                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`   | Required for modules using OpenAI embeddings or chat completion |
| `TMDB_API_KEY`     | Used for retrieving metadata from TMDB (Movie Database API)     |
| `HUGGING_FACE_KEY` | Enables usage of hosted models via Hugging Face Inference API   |

These can be placed in a `.env` file or exported via shell:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export TMDB_API_KEY=...
export HUGGING_FACE_KEY=...
```
